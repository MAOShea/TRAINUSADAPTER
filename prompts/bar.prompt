Create an Übersicht widget that serves as a menubar replacement displaying basic system information and the currently playing song from Spotify, YouTube, or SoundCloud. The widget should use React/JSX with a sleek, minimal design that mimics a macOS menubar. Include real-time music player integration, system status indicators, and smooth animations. Implement proper state management for music playback detection and system monitoring with clean typography and appropriate spacing.
