Put together an Übersicht widget that controls the placement and positioning of other widgets on the desktop with drag-and-drop functionality. The widget should use React/JSX with a positioning interface allowing users to arrange, resize, and configure widget locations. Include coordinate management, positioning controls, and layout management features. Implement a clean, utility-focused design with proper widget positioning and desktop integration capabilities.
