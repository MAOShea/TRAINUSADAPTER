Come up with an Übersicht widget that displays Plex server activity via Tautulli. The widget should connect to Tautulli API every minute to fetch current streaming sessions, display active streams with show/movie posters and background art, show playback progress with custom progress bars, display user avatars, device information, and streaming quality details, handle both TV episodes and movies with appropriate metadata formatting, use a card-based layout with background images and semi-transparent overlays, and include proper error handling for when no streams are active. The widget should be configurable for Tautulli host, API key, and positioning.
