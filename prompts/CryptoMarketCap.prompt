Create an Übersicht widget that displays the latest cryptocurrency market cap. The widget should fetch real-time data from the CoinGecko API every 5 minutes, display the total market cap with proper number formatting (commas), show the 24-hour percentage change with color coding (green for positive, red for negative), and use a clean minimalist design with semi-transparent dark background, right-aligned text, and Helvetica Neue font family. The widget should be positioned in the top-right corner with rounded corners and proper spacing.
