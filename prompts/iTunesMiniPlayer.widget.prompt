Create a widget that displays a mini iTunes player showing the cover art of the currently playing song. The widget should use React/JSX with a compact, elegant design featuring album artwork, track information, and playback controls. Include smooth transitions for track changes, proper image handling for album covers, and a minimal interface that doesn't obstruct the desktop. Implement real-time updates and error handling for iTunes integration.
