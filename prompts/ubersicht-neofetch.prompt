I need a widget that displays Neofetch output on your desktop with system information and ASCII art. The widget should use React/JSX with a terminal-style interface showing system details, hardware information, and ASCII art logos. Include Neofetch command execution, system parsing, and terminal aesthetics. Implement a clean, technical design with proper system information display and terminal styling.
