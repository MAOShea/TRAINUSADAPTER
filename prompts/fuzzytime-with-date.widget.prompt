Show me an Übersicht widget that displays fuzzy time and the date in the top left of the desktop, supporting both German and English languages. The widget should use React/JSX with a clean, readable interface showing human-readable time expressions (e.g., "quarter past three") and current date. Include language switching functionality, customizable time formats, and proper localization. Implement a minimal design that doesn't obstruct desktop content while providing clear time and date information.
