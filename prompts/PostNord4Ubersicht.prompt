I'd like a widget that displays mail delivery dates for Swedish postal codes using PostNord tracking information. The widget should use React/JSX with a postal tracking interface showing delivery dates, tracking status, and postal information. Include PostNord API integration, zip code validation, and delivery tracking features. Implement a clean, postal-focused design with proper Swedish postal system integration and tracking functionality.
