Generate an Übersicht widget that displays a slow moving particle effect for visual appeal on the desktop. The widget should use React/JSX with animated particle systems featuring floating elements, smooth animations, and customizable particle properties. Include configurable particle count, movement patterns, colors, and opacity effects. Implement performance-optimized animations using CSS transforms and requestAnimationFrame for smooth particle movement without impacting system performance.
