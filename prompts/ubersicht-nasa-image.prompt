Can you make a widget that displays NASA's daily astronomy picture on your desktop with space-themed content and educational information. The widget should use React/JSX with a space interface showing daily astronomical images, descriptions, and NASA content. Include NASA API integration, image caching, and educational content. Implement a beautiful, space-focused design with proper astronomical content display and NASA branding.
