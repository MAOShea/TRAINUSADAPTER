I want an Übersicht widget that brings Conky-style system monitoring to macOS, displaying comprehensive system information in a Linux desktop widget style. The widget should use React/JSX with a customizable layout showing CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, network activity, and other system metrics. Include configurable themes, real-time updates, and a clean information hierarchy with proper data visualization and responsive design elements.
