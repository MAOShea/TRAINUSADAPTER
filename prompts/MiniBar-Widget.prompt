I want an Übersicht widget that serves as a minimal menubar replacement with essential system information and controls. The widget should use React/JSX with a compact, streamlined interface showing system status, time, and quick access features. Include customizable components, minimal resource usage, and clean typography. Implement a lightweight design focused on efficiency and desktop integration with smooth animations and proper system monitoring.
