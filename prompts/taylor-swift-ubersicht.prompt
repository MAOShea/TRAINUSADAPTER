Can you create a widget that displays random Taylor Swift images from Imgur with quotes in a 1989 polaroid frame aesthetic. The widget should use React/JSX with a nostalgic, music-themed interface featuring polaroid-style frames, Taylor Swift imagery, and inspirational quotes. Include Imgur API integration, quote rotation, and authentic 1989 album styling. Implement a fan-focused design with proper image handling and Taylor Swift branding elements.
