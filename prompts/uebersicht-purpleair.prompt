Create an Übersicht widget that displays air quality index (AQI) data from the Purple Air API with real-time environmental monitoring. The widget should use React/JSX with an air quality interface showing AQI values, health recommendations, and pollution levels. Include Purple Air API integration, location-based data, and color-coded health indicators. Implement a clean, health-focused design with proper API handling and environmental data visualization.
