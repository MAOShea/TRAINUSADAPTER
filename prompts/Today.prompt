I'd like an Übersicht widget that displays daily information including today's date, today in history from History.com, today's news from Reuters, and today's word from WordSmith.org. The widget should use React/JSX with a clean, modern interface that presents multiple daily information sources in an organized layout. Include proper error handling for API failures and implement responsive design with appropriate styling for desktop display.
