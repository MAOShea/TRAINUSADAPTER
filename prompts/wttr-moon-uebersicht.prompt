Create an Übersicht widget that displays moon information using wttr.in/Moon API. The widget should use React/JSX with an astronomical interface showing moon phase, illumination percentage, moonrise/moonset times, and other lunar data. Include visual moon phase representation, astronomical calculations, and a clean design focused on lunar information. Implement proper API integration with wttr.in/Moon and real-time updates for accurate lunar data.
