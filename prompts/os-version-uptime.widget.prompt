Create an Übersicht widget that displays the macOS version and system uptime information. The widget should use React/JSX with a system information interface showing OS version details, uptime duration, and system status. Include proper system command execution for version detection, uptime calculation, and a clean technical display. Implement a minimal design focused on system administrators with real-time updates and proper error handling.
