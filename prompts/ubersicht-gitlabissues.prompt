Create an Übersicht widget that displays open GitLab issues for project management and development tracking. The widget should use React/JSX with a GitLab-focused interface showing issue titles, authors, labels, and creation dates. Include GitLab API integration, project configuration, issue filtering, and real-time updates. Implement a clean, developer-friendly design with proper GitLab styling and error handling for API failures.
