Create an Übersicht widget that displays the number of days since March 1, 2020. The widget should calculate the difference between the current date and a configurable start date, update the count every hour, display the number in large bold text with a custom rotation angle, use a background image with proper positioning and sizing, and style the text with specific padding and font weight. The widget should be positioned in the top-right area with a square layout and centered text alignment.
