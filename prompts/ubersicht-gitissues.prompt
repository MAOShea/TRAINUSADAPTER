Create an Übersicht widget that displays the latest issues from a GitHub repository. The widget should use React/JSX with a GitHub-focused interface showing issue titles, authors, creation dates, and status indicators. Include GitHub API integration, repository configuration, issue filtering options, and real-time updates. Implement a clean, developer-friendly design with proper GitHub styling elements and error handling for API failures.
