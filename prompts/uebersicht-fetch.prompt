Create an Übersicht widget that displays system, network, and weather information similar to neofetch. The widget should execute shell scripts to gather system information including hostname, OS, model, kernel, CPU, GPU, uptime, memory, battery, and network details, fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API using geolocation, display information in organized sections with ASCII-style borders and formatting, use Andale Mono font with color-coded labels, update system info every minute and weather every hour, and position the widget at the bottom-left with proper padding and styling. The widget should handle API configuration for weather units and include proper error handling.
