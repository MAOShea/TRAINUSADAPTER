I'm creating an Übersicht widget that displays a simple calendar showing a list of events for a given day with clean, minimal styling. The widget should use React/JSX with a calendar interface showing daily events, dates, and event details. Include event parsing, date navigation, and event management features. Implement a clean, calendar-focused design with proper event handling and user-friendly date display.
