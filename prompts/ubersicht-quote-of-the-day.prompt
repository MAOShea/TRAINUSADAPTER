Could you build an Übersicht widget that displays daily inspirational quotes from the They Said So Quotes API. The widget should fetch quotes from multiple categories (love, life, funny, inspire, art) every 6 hours, use localStorage to maintain consistent category selection between refreshes, display the quote with proper typography including quotation marks, show the author attribution, include a background image from the API, use a centered layout with semi-transparent background overlay, and style the text with shadows and proper spacing. The widget should be positioned at the bottom of the screen with full width and responsive design.
