I'm looking for a widget that monitors Reddit subreddit member counts. The widget should fetch member data from multiple subreddits via Reddit's API every 6 hours, display each subreddit with its icon (or fallback Reddit logo SVG), show the subreddit name and member count, use a glassmorphism design with backdrop blur effects, semi-transparent white backgrounds, and subtle shadows, arrange subreddits in a vertical list with proper spacing, handle API errors gracefully, and use a modern card-based layout with rounded corners and smooth transitions.
