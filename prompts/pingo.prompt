Create an Übersicht widget that displays a 10-ping average to monitor network connectivity and latency. The widget should use React/JSX with a network monitoring interface showing ping statistics, average response times, and connection quality indicators. Include visual latency indicators, color coding for different ping ranges, and a compact design suitable for network monitoring. Implement proper ping command execution and data parsing with real-time updates.
