Create an Übersicht widget that displays a dark-mode GitHub contributions graph with dynamic scaling to fit the widget's size. The widget should use React/JSX with a GitHub-focused interface showing contribution patterns, activity levels, and coding statistics. Include GitHub API integration, contribution parsing, and dynamic scaling. Implement a clean, developer-focused design with proper GitHub styling and contribution visualization.
