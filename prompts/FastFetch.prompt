I'd like a widget that displays system information using FastFetch. The widget should execute the fastfetch command with DarkOS logo every 10 seconds, parse the HTML output to separate ASCII art logo from system information text, display both sections side-by-side with proper spacing, use monospace font for consistent formatting, maintain the original ASCII art styling with bold formatting, display system info in regular weight, and use a transparent background with white text positioned in the top-left corner with proper z-index layering.
