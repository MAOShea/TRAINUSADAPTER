Create an Übersicht widget that displays Docker container information in a modern table format. The widget should execute the 'docker ps' command every 5 seconds, parse the output to extract container details, display containers in a clean table with Docker icon header and timestamp, show container status with color-coded health indicators (blue for healthy, red for unhealthy, yellow for starting), format port mappings with arrow indicators, use IBM Plex Mono font with dark background and rounded corners, and include proper error handling for Docker daemon issues.
