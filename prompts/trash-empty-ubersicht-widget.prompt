Create an Übersicht widget that monitors trash files and provides a double-click interface to clear trash contents. The widget should use React/JSX with a simple trash monitoring interface showing trash status, file count, and clear functionality. Include trash monitoring, file counting, and safe deletion confirmation. Implement a minimal design focused on system maintenance with proper file system integration and user-friendly trash management.
