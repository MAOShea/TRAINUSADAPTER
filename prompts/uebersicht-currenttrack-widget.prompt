Create an Übersicht widget that displays the current track from Apple Music or Spotify. The widget should execute an AppleScript command every second to get current playback information, parse the output to extract track name, artist, position, and length, display the information in a clean format with artist and track name, show current position and total length with proper time formatting, include a visual progress bar that updates in real-time, use Input Serif Narrow font with proper spacing and sizing, and only display when music is actively playing. The widget should be positioned in the top-left corner with responsive sizing.
