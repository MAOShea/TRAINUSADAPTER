I'm looking for an Übersicht widget that monitors PBS (Portable Batch System) job statuses for high-performance computing environments. The widget should use React/JSX with a cluster computing interface showing job queues, status indicators, resource usage, and completion times. Include PBS command integration, real-time job monitoring, and proper error handling for cluster environments. Implement a technical design suitable for HPC administrators and researchers.
