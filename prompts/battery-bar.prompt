Create an Übersicht widget that displays a battery life indicator bar at the top of the screen. The widget should execute the 'pmset -g batt' command every 5 seconds to get battery percentage, display a horizontal bar that spans the screen width with dynamic positioning based on battery level, use color-coded styling (green for >80%, yellow for >55%, orange for >30%, red for lower), make the bar thickness and colors configurable, and position it as a fixed element at the top of the screen with proper padding and overflow handling.
