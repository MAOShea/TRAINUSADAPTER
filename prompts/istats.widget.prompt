Create an Übersicht widget that integrates with the iStats Ruby gem to display SMC (System Management Controller) information about your Mac system. The widget should use React/JSX with a comprehensive monitoring interface showing temperature sensors, fan speeds, battery status, and other hardware metrics. Include real-time data visualization, customizable display options, and proper error handling for SMC data access with a clean, technical aesthetic suitable for system administrators.
