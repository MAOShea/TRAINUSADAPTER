Make an Übersicht widget that receives Gotify push notifications directly on your desktop with real-time notification display. The widget should use React/JSX with a notification interface showing push messages, notification history, and Gotify integration. Include Gotify API connectivity, notification parsing, and real-time updates. Implement a clean, notification-focused design with proper push notification handling and user-friendly message display.
