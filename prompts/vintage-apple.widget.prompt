Create an Übersicht widget that displays vintage Apple computer styling with modern system information. The widget should execute system_profiler to get hardware information every 10 minutes, parse the output to extract model name, memory, processor details, and core count, format the information in a vintage Apple computer style with model number and specifications, display a classic Apple logo from 1977, use EB Garamond serif font with vintage styling, apply retro visual effects including drop shadows and 3D borders, position the widget in the bottom-left corner with proper spacing from the dock, and create a nostalgic computing experience that combines modern system data with classic Apple aesthetics.
