Create an Übersicht widget that visualizes time at different timezones around the world with a comprehensive world clock interface. The widget should use React/JSX with a global time display showing multiple cities, time zones, and current times. Include timezone selection, 24-hour format options, and visual indicators for different regions. Implement a clean, international design with proper timezone calculations and real-time updates.
