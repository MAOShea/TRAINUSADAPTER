Create an Übersicht widget that displays the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages of the system. The widget should use React/JSX with a clean, technical interface showing load average values in real-time. Include visual indicators for load levels, color coding for different load ranges, and a compact design suitable for system monitoring. Implement proper data parsing and formatting with smooth updates and minimal resource usage.
