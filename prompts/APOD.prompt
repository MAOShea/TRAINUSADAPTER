Build me an Übersicht widget that displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) as desktop wallpaper with image and video rendering capabilities. The widget should use React/JSX with a space-themed interface showing daily astronomical images, descriptions, and video content. Include NASA APOD API integration, image caching, and desktop wallpaper functionality. Implement a beautiful, space-focused design with proper media handling and astronomical content display.
