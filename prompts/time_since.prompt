Build an Übersicht widget that shows the time elapsed since a specified date and time. The widget should use React/JSX with a customizable countdown/timer interface allowing users to set target dates and times. Include multiple time format options (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds), visual progress indicators, and the ability to track multiple time periods. Implement a clean, readable design with proper date/time parsing and real-time updates.
