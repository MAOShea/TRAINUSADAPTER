Create an Übersicht widget that displays a news ticker using newsapi.org for real-time news updates. The widget should use React/JSX with a scrolling ticker interface showing news headlines, sources, and publication times. Include newsapi.org integration, customizable news categories, smooth scrolling animations, and clickable headlines. Implement a clean, news-focused design with proper API handling and real-time updates for current events.
