Create an Übersicht widget that displays air quality index (AQI) information for your city. The widget should use React/JSX with an environmental monitoring interface showing AQI values, air quality levels, and health recommendations. Include real-time air quality data, color-coded indicators for different AQI ranges, and location-based weather integration. Implement a clean, health-focused design with proper API integration and user-friendly air quality information display.
