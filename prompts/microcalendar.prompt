Create an Übersicht widget that displays a tiny calendar showing iCal events in the space next to the macOS Dock with compact, efficient design. The widget should use React/JSX with a minimal calendar interface showing upcoming events, dates, and quick event information. Include iCal integration, event parsing, and dock-adjacent positioning. Implement a compact, productivity-focused design with proper calendar data handling and space-efficient layout.
