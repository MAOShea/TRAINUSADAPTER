Create an Übersicht widget that provides multi-location weather forecasts using wttr.in API, storing weather information locally for offline access. The widget should use React/JSX with a comprehensive weather display showing current conditions, forecasts, and multiple location support. Include weather icons, temperature displays, precipitation data, and local caching functionality. Implement a clean, weather-focused design with proper API integration and offline fallback capabilities.
