Create an Übersicht widget that displays a countdown timer to your ultimate demise using a heart-based visual metaphor. The widget should calculate time lived and time remaining based on configurable birthday and life expectancy settings, update every second with precise time calculations, display five heart icons where filled hearts represent remaining life percentage, show detailed time breakdowns in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, use a centered layout with custom heart styling and colors, and include proper time formatting with number localization. The widget should be positioned in the bottom area with a philosophical approach to mortality awareness.
