Create an Übersicht widget that displays the count of running virtual machines from VMware Fusion. The widget should use React/JSX with a simple, informative interface showing the current number of active VMs. Include real-time monitoring of VM status, visual indicators for different VM states, and a compact design that provides quick system overview. Implement proper VMware Fusion integration with error handling and smooth updates.
