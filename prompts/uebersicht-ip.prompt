Create an Übersicht widget that shows IP addresses of all network interfaces including WAN address. The widget should execute a shell script every 10 seconds to gather network interface information, parse JSON output to extract interface names, IP addresses, CIDR notation, and router information, display the data in a clean table format with interface names and addresses, use Fira Code Retina font with proper spacing, show CIDR notation and router information with different opacity levels for visual hierarchy, handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages, and position the widget in the bottom-left corner with minimal styling and white text.
