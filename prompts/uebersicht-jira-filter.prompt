Can you build an Übersicht widget that displays JIRA filter results for project management and issue tracking. The widget should use React/JSX with a professional interface showing issue summaries, status indicators, assignees, and priority levels. Include JIRA API integration, filter configuration, real-time updates, and proper authentication handling. Implement a clean, business-focused design with proper error handling and customizable display options for different JIRA workflows.
