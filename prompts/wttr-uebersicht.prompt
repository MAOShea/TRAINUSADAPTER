Make a widget that displays a minimal ASCII-Art weather forecast using wttr.in API. The widget should use React/JSX with a terminal-style interface showing weather information in ASCII art format. Include current conditions, temperature, and forecast data presented in a clean, monospace font design. Implement proper API integration with wttr.in and maintain the ASCII art aesthetic while ensuring readability and real-time updates.
